Ultimately, based on findings made by the DOC that imports of such articles threaten to impair U.S. national security, President Trump issued proclamations in March 2018 pursuant to which significant additional duties were imposed on imports of such articles. The Administration's launch of national security investigations under this little-used trade action that dates back to the Cold War - first on steel and aluminum products and more recently on uranium and autos - raises many questions as to the positive and negative effects for U.S. and foreign producers of the covered items, U.S. importers, and downstream-users in key industries such as the construction industry, as well as the impact on relationships with our global trading partners, especially the European Union, Canada, Mexico, and countries in Latin America.
