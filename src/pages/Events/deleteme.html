title: "November 8, 2018: The U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement - What's New and What's Not in a Post-NAFTA North America?",
content: (<React.Fragment><p>A non-CLE program proudly presented by the Inter-American Affairs Committee of the D.C. Bar and the D.C.
Bar International Law Community, in cooperation with the Inter-American Legal Affairs Committee,
International Trade Committee, and International Finance Committee of the D.C. Bar International Law
Community; American Bar Association Section of International Law; Association of Women in International
Trade (WIIT); Customs and International Trade Bar Association (CITBA); Inter-American Bar Association
(DC Chapter); and the Virginia State Bar International Practice Section.</p>
<p>President Trump made renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) one of his
Administration's primary trade policy objectives. On September 30, 2018, the three countries, the
United States, Mexico, and Canada, announced that they had reached consensus on a new framework for
trade in North America, which President Trump stated would be known as the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement
(USMCA). While many NAFTA provisions are retained in the USMCA, there are significant differences
relating to a number of areas, including those pertaining to rules of origin for automobiles, market
access provisions related to agriculture (e.g., dairy) products, and intellectual property rights
protection. In addition, the USMCA includes chapters relating to certain subjects that were not
addressed in the NAFTA, including ones pertaining to anti-corruption, digital trade, and good regulatory
practices. A diverse panel will discuss the similarities and differences between the USMCA and the
NAFTA from the perspectives of US, Mexican, and Canadian practitioners, and they will offer their
thoughts on the wide-ranging implications that the USMCA, once implemented, could hold for businesses
and consumers in the three countries.</p>
<p>The event will take place from 12:15 - 2:00pm at the DC Bar, 901 4th Street NW, Washington, DC 20001.</p>

title: "June 21, 2018: Section 232 Cases - Protecting U.S. National Security or Risking International Trade Wars?",
content: (<React.Fragment><p>The ABA Section of International Law, Customs and International Trade Bar Association, Inter-American Bar
Association (DC Chapter), and the Virginia State Bar International Practice Section cordially invites
everyone to an off-the-record, non-CLE luncheon program to discuss the use of Section 232 by the Trump
Administration.</p>
<p>Shortly after taking office, President Trump directed the U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) to initiate
investigations relating to imports of steel mill and aluminum articles pursuant to Section 232 of the
Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended (19 U.S.C. sec. 1862). Ultimately, based on findings made
by the DOC that imports of such articles threaten to impair U.S. national security, President Trump
issued proclamations in March 2018 pursuant to which significant additional duties were imposed on
imports of such articles. The Administration's launch of national security investigations under
this little-used trade action that dates back to the Cold War - first on steel and aluminum products and
more recently on uranium and autos - raises many questions as to the positive and negative effects for
U.S. and foreign producers of the covered items, U.S. importers, and downstream-users in key industries
such as the construction industry, as well as the impact on relationships with our global trading
partners, especially the European Union, Canada, Mexico, and countries in Latin America. During
the program, a panel of experienced practitioners with diverse backgrounds will discuss the new tariffs,
the products covered, those countries exempted and those in limbo, and the product exclusion process.
 The panel will also explore WTO actions and threatened actions arising from this Administration's
deployment of Section 232, Section 301, and Section 201 tariffs, and whether, especially in the case of
Section 232, we are protecting national security or risking international trade wars.</p>
